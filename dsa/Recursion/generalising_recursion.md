# Difference between with Loop and Recursion
Recursion is also like repeating
But the difference is a loop only have a ascending phase,
recursion have ascending phase(calling time) as well as descending phase(returning time)

## Loop
have:
1. ascending phase

## Recursion
have:
1. ascending phase(calling time)
2. descending phase(returning time)

This is the strength or power of recursion that you can utilize or exploit it for writing code easier.
