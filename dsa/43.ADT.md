# ADT (Abstract Data Type)

## Data Type
1. representation of data
2. operation on data

```c

/* integer */

int main()
{
    int a = 12; // in memory representation = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100

    a + 10 // some operation belong with this data, int have arithmetic + - * / %

    // we don't know how + actually work in memory, but we use them, so + for us is abstract
    return 0;
}
```

example:
when you create a class, the class have his own representation and operation, then you hide the operation detail, that is ADT(abstract data type)
